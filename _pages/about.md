<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a M.S.E student in the Shenzhen Institute for Advanced Study at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), supervised by Xili Han. I received my B.E degree from college of Electronic Engineering, [South China Agricultural University](https://www.scau.edu.cn/). I used to intern at Guangdong Institute of Intelligence Science and Technology, [GDIIST](https://www.gdiist.cn/).

My research interest includes IC, FPGA, Computer Architecture, Hardware Acceleration and HPC.

<font color="red">I'll be graduating in June 2025, and am actively looking for the Ph.D program and full-time IC/FPGA development engineer positions.</font>

[**Project**](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=zh-CN&user=0PbLvCEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=0PbLvCEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C) <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='0PbLvCEAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C'></span></strong>
- This article introduces the characteristics of FPGA board-level test systems and outlines some common memory fault models and memory test algorithms.
- The memory test system is constructed by utilizing the FPGA chip of Xilinx Company, which has the advantages of low cost, high flexibility and configurability compared with the traditional ATE machine test, making the memory test more convenient and faster.
